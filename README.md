# BattleGameTester
Project for testing stats and balance units in a board strategy game.


## ![Battlegrid] (ExampleImages/Battlegrid.png)
The basis of the game is a grid of cells on which units can be placed.
New units can be added to the field, which can be modified with attack/defense characteristics, dice roll stats. Units can be saved as "Saved Squad" to quick spawn on battlegrid.

## ![Saved Squads] (ExampleImages/SavedSquads.png)
Squads you can spawn at battlegrid. (Saves is .json format file)

## ![Squad Stats] (ExampleImages/Stats.png)
You can configure squad stats using UI.
