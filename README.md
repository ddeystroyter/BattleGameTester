# BattleGameTester
Project for testing stats and balance units in a board strategy game.

### BattleGrid

The basis of the game is a grid of cells on which units can be placed.
New units can be added to the field, which can be modified with attack/defense characteristics, dice roll stats. Units can be saved as "Saved Squad" to quick spawn on battlegrid.
